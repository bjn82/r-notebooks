# r-notebooks
Class notes from my graduate classes taken in R Markdown. 

**Note**: .csv files are unfortunately not included as they are not my property. 

Since these are my class notes, there may be mistakes in them. 
Markdown is a really wonderful thing, and I would highly recommend people give it a try.
